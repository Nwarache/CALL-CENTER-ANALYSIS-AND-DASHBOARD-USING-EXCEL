It would be advised here that the call center concentrates more on Chatbot responses as it generated 25%, the highest traffic based on the data given and analysis observed next was customer inquiries via E-mail with 23% and a total of 7,740 mails.

The call centers in Los Angeles received the highest percentage of calls and customer engagement via call center, chatbot, e-mails and web. It was recommended that more efforts be put in place in Los Angeles, as it had 13,734 total calls as against the total customer engagement of 32,941. 

Baltimore ranked second as observed after the analysis with a total of 11,021 for chatbot, emails, web and call centers.
Los Angeles and Baltimore should be states for concentration by the call center as they receive more calls based on billing issues and sentiments involving turnaround time.

It was observed generally across call centers in these states, that billing issues is a concern and it was the highest reason for calls across all regions and call centers closely followed by issues on payments.
